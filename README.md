# Community Code of Conduct and Guidelines

We encourage respectful behavior, this includes:

- Being considerate, constructive, and helpful.
- Not engaging in:
    + discriminatory, (e.g. racist language)
    + harassing, 
    + physically threatening behavior, speech, and/or imagery. (e.g. Doxxing)

- Not engaging in repeated unwanted contact.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and
disagreement often yields positive results.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the
behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and
easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If
you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is
threatening or harassing, you may report it.
